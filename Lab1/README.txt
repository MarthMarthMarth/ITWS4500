This lab was fine but I think the instructions could be a little more clear on exactly what is expected.

Hashtags are located beneath each tweet in the footer when there is a hashtag in that tweet. They are clickable and link to the appropriate twitter hashtag page. Likes are also displayed in the footer but as far as I've seen each tweet in the sample has 0 likes. I manually added likes to test and it will display the appropriate number if there is a tweet with likes.

You can select three speeds fot tweet scrolling. The default is the 3 second scroll. 

Just view Index.html and the page should be good to go.
