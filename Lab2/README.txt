This lab was fine but it was a lot of work. That's what I've heard about this class anyway. The only thing I wish was that there was some sort of rubric so we know how much work we really need to put into these things. I'm not sure if there's anything else to write here. There's enough documentation that you can delve into the details of the code if you really want to, but it's nothing special honestly. Just some basic API calls, processing, and front-end beautification.
